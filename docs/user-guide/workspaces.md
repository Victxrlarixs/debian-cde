# Workspaces User Guide

CDE provides 4 virtual workspaces for better organization and productivity.

## What are Workspaces?

Workspaces are like having 4 separate desktops. Each workspace can have different windows and applications, but they all share the same settings and files.

Think of them as rooms in a house - you can be in one room at a time, but all your stuff is still there when you return.

## The Workspace Switcher

Located in the Front Panel, the workspace switcher shows 4 buttons:
- **One** - Workspace 1
- **Two** - Workspace 2
- **Three** - Workspace 3
- **Four** - Workspace 4

The active workspace is highlighted.

### Visual Preview

Hover over any workspace button to see a miniature preview showing:
- Application icons for open windows
- Window positions and layout
- Number of open windows

This helps you quickly identify which workspace contains what you're looking for without switching to it.

## Switching Workspaces

### Using Mouse

Click any workspace button to switch to that workspace.

### Using Keyboard

| Shortcut | Workspace |
|----------|-----------|
| `Ctrl+Alt+1` | Workspace 1 |
| `Ctrl+Alt+2` | Workspace 2 |
| `Ctrl+Alt+3` | Workspace 3 |
| `Ctrl+Alt+4` | Workspace 4 |

## Using Workspaces Effectively

### Organize by Task

**Workspace 1: Main Work**
- XEmacs for coding
- Terminal for commands
- File Manager for files

**Workspace 2: Communication**
- Email (future)
- Chat (future)
- Calendar

**Workspace 3: Reference**
- Documentation
- Netscape Navigator
- Notes

**Workspace 4: Miscellaneous**
- Process Monitor
- System tools
- Temporary work

### Organize by Project

**Workspace 1: Project A**
- All files for Project A
- Related applications

**Workspace 2: Project B**
- All files for Project B
- Related applications

**Workspace 3: Project C**
- All files for Project C
- Related applications

**Workspace 4: General**
- Email, calendar, etc.

### Organize by Context

**Workspace 1: Focus**
- Single application, full screen
- No distractions

**Workspace 2: Multitasking**
- Multiple windows
- Side-by-side work

**Workspace 3: Research**
- Browser, notes, references

**Workspace 4: Admin**
- System tools, settings

## Moving Windows Between Workspaces

### Method 1: Window Menu

1. Right-click window title bar
2. Select "Move to Workspace"
3. Choose destination workspace

### Method 2: Drag and Drop

1. Drag window to workspace button
2. Drop on desired workspace
3. Window moves there

## Workspace Features

### Independent Windows

Each workspace has its own set of windows. Opening an application in Workspace 1 doesn't affect Workspace 2.

### Shared Settings

All workspaces share:
- Color palette
- Backdrop
- Font size
- System settings

### Persistent State

Windows stay where you left them. Switch away and back - everything is still there.

## Tips for Productivity

### Use All 4 Workspaces

Don't limit yourself to one workspace. Spread out your work.

### Develop a System

Create a consistent organization system and stick to it.

### Learn the Shortcuts

`Ctrl+Alt+1-4` is much faster than clicking.

### Minimize Clutter

Keep each workspace focused on specific tasks.

### Review Regularly

Periodically check all workspaces and close unused windows.

## Common Workflows

### Developer Workflow

1. **Workspace 1**: Code editor (XEmacs)
2. **Workspace 2**: Terminal for commands
3. **Workspace 3**: Documentation/browser
4. **Workspace 4**: File Manager

### Writer Workflow

1. **Workspace 1**: Writing (XEmacs)
2. **Workspace 2**: Research (Netscape)

### Student Workflow

1. **Workspace 1**: Assignments (XEmacs)
2. **Workspace 2**: Research materials

4. **Workspace 4**: Organization

## Keyboard Shortcuts

| Shortcut | Action |
|----------|--------|
| `Ctrl+Alt+1` | Switch to Workspace 1 |
| `Ctrl+Alt+2` | Switch to Workspace 2 |

## Troubleshooting

### Can't Find a Window

Check all 4 workspaces - it might be on another one.

### Workspace Looks Empty

You might not have opened any applications there yet.

### Shortcut Not Working

Make sure you're pressing all three keys: Ctrl+Alt+Number.

## Advanced Tips

### Workspace Naming

Remember what each workspace is for:
- Write it down
- Create a mental map
- Be consistent

### Window Placement

Arrange windows consistently in each workspace for muscle memory.

### Quick Switching

Practice switching workspaces without looking at the switcher.
