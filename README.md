## 🧠 About the Project

**CDE Simulation on Debian** is a front-end experiment that brings the iconic **Common Desktop Environment** to life in the browser. Inspired by CDE’s vintage aesthetic, this project recreates its unmistakable interface, including the **Style Manager**, classic color themes, and a functional-looking terminal — all running within a Debian-flavored simulation.

The project lives at **[debian.com.mx](https://debian.com.mx)** and serves as a tribute to early Unix desktop environments as well as a playground for retro UI development.
