## ✨ A Journey Through Time

This isn't just a website; it's a living desktop. From the moment the terminal scrolls past your eyes, you're not just a "visitor"—you're a "user" of a classic Unix system.

### 🎨 Your Desktop, Your Rules

Open the **Style Manager** to instantly repaint your environment. Whether it's the professional _Platinum_, the high-contrast _Midnight_, or the vibrant _Sunset_, the entire OS follows your lead without a single reload.

### 📁 A Responsive World

Everything reacts to you. Drag windows by their title bars, hover over icons to see them glow, and explore a **Virtual Filesystem** where you can create your own digital corner. It's the tactile feel of the 90s with the speed of today.
