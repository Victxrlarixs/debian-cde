## ✨ Features

## 🎯 What You Can Do

- **🖱️ Live Theme Customization**  
  Open the **Style Manager** and switch between ten classic CDE themes (Platinum, Olive, Marine, Sand, Midnight, Cobalt, Forest, Sunset, Amber, Monochrome). Colors update instantly — no reload, no waiting.

- **🔤 Personalize Typography**  
  Adjust font family, size, weight and line height in real time. A live preview shows exactly how your changes will look.

- **💻 Explore the Terminal**  
  Launch the auto‑mode terminal and watch it type out a continuous tutorial of Unix/Linux commands (`ls`, `cd`, `mkdir`, `git`, `docker` …). It feels like an old‑school instructional video, right in your browser.

- **📁 Navigate a Virtual Filesystem**  
  Use the **File Manager** to browse, create, rename, and delete files and folders. Right‑click for a context menu, use the menu bar, and experience a fully interactive file system.

- **📸 Capture the Moment**  
  Click the camera icon in the system tray and instantly download a screenshot of your entire desktop — perfect for sharing or just keeping a memory.

- **📊 Peek Under the Hood**  
  Open the **Process Monitor** for a real‑time, keyboard‑navigable list of simulated processes. Move with arrow keys, “kill” a process with `k`, and watch colorful CPU/memory bars change dynamically.

- **🧩 Discover Subtle Details**  
  Hover over icons, drag windows, and notice the careful attention to retro UI behavior — every click and movement feels authentic.
